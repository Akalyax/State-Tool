# State-Tool
Tool to make and change states
I often found myself creating state machines for various projects but never felt fully satisfied with the solutions I came up with. Each time, I approached it differently, but something was always missing.

One day, I decided to take things further and crafted my own scripts in a way that truly resonated with me. This approach not only simplified my workflow but also made several tasks significantly easier. And some of my colleagues were eager to do the same when we worked together.

That's why I developed this tool: to make the creation of state machines and break my code into well-defined, separate steps. Each step is isolated, allowing for easy detection and ensuring that one step never interferes with another. This structure also makes it effortless to add or remove steps as needed.

Here is an exemple of how it is used:
-
When you open the tool window, you will have something like this : 
![Unity_noEwLXSgkK](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81cba755-0d0d-4965-ae34-038385ed8380)

---
If you enter every aspect correctly (scripts names, folder acces, etc) you will get a confirmation window : 
![Unity_6yiwuutEZn](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9e7848e-842e-4419-b1d0-782b083a1768)

If a problem arises the confirmation window will inform you where the error is.

Here is the result of the generation with the templates:

You can add a new script directly to the main Manager with this window (automatic add):

You can change the template:
-
You have acces to the folder "Templates" where you can modify the basic Templates for your specific need.

DISCLAIMER: 
-
Currently, when you delete a phase, it will not be remove from the manager, it's in my To Do List
